# Contributing
Updated 7/21/2025

Thanks for your interest!
First, make sure to [install](https://swesmith.com/getting_started/installation/) SWE-smith, which should be super easy!
Then, there's several ways to contribute.

* Add support for new languages
* Add repositories
* Add task instances
* Add problem statements

Each of these is described in more detail below. The priority level is indicated as
* 🔴 `p1` - High priority. We'd love help here!
* 🟠 `p2` - Medium priority
* 🟡 `p3` - Low priority

<hr />

## Support New Languages

🟡 `p3`

To generate bugs, SWE-smith relies on language-specific tooling to parse a codebase into individual programmatic entities (e.g., functions, classes, methods).
These tools are located under the `swesmith/bug_gen/adapters` folder.

We warmly welcome contributions to support new languages! [#111](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/111), [#84](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/84), [#66](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/66), [#60](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/60), [#34](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/34), and [#28](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/28) are great references for PRs that added support for a new language.

The best way to understand this is by looking at the PRs and existing adapters, so we'll be brief here! Some languages we'd love to see:
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Swift

If you need help, open an issue and ask [@acrmp](https://github.com/acrmp), [@john-b-yang](https://github.com/john-b-yang), or [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) for help! To contribute, make a new PR with the corresponding code.

## Support New Repositories

🔴 `p1` (Especially non-Python repos)

The second puzzle piece to making bug generation work is providing programmatic definitions for GitHub repositories, which we refer to as `RepoProfile`'s in the codebase.
See `swesmith/profiles` for examples.

Each `RepoProfile` class corresponds to a unique GitHub repository + commit combination.
For instance, `Instagram__MonkeyType.70c3acf6` refers to the `Instagram/MonkeyType` repository at commit `70c3acf6`.
For each `RepoProfile`, you may have to fill out several fields, such as...
* `dockerfile` property: The `Dockerfile` that builds a Docker image with the repository installed.
* `test_cmd` property: The command that runs the repository's test suite.
* `log_parser` function: A function that parses the logs produced by the repository's test suite.
We've annotated `RepoProfile` in `swesmith/profiles/base.py` with docstrings to (1) help you understand the purpose of each function/property, and (2) point out which fields are required, optional, or have reasonable defaults.

Check out [#116](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/116) and [d8b20f3f](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/commit/d8b20f3f2ee13e8c9b6ef9495c25e9704008d07a) for examples of PRs / commits that added new repositories.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to populate the `eval_sets` property. See [#136](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith/pull/136) for an explanation.
> 
> tl;dr - There's several SWE-bench style benchmarks out there. If we add a repo that's also used in one of these benchmarks, we want to indicate this in the `eval_sets` property.
> This way, if we want to train repos on a specific benchmark, we know which ones to exclude.

We're always looking to add more repositories, so if you have a favorite open-source project, please consider adding it! To contribute, make a new PR with the corresponding code.

If you need help, open an issue and ask [@richardzhuang0412](https://github.com/richardzhuang0412), [@acrmp](https://github.com/acrmp), [@john-b-yang](https://github.com/john-b-yang), or [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) for help!

## Create task instances

🔴 `p1` (Especially non-Python repos)

Generating task instances is very easy.
* The ["Create Instances"](https://swesmith.com/guides/create_instances/) section of the SWE-smith docs describes this repository's bug generation strategies in detail.
* The [Youtube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1b-qYhmIXEhyaUafmTYmMI4l9dbCLNix&si=7xnYixLc7MJSy7UU) shows you what things should look like when you run the scripts.
* `scripts/cheatsheet.sh` contains the CLI commands to run scripts. Re-adapt these commands to a new repository, and run.

If you have any trouble running these scripts, please open an issue and ask [@john-b-yang](https://github.com/john-b-yang) or [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) for help!
For the LM Rewrite/Modify and PR mirror methods, you'll have to initialize a `.env` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, depending on which LM you want to use.

To contribute task instances, run any of the `python -m swesmith.bug_gen.*` scripts. Every script will populate a `logs/bug_gen/<repo>/` folder, which will contain the generated bugs.
Zip this folder, then upload the zipped file as a new PR.
From there, we then perform the following additional steps:
* `python swesmith/harness/valid.py logs/bug_gen/<repo>_all_patches.json`, to filter out bugs that don't break any existing unit tests.
* `python swesmith/harness/eval.py logs/run_validation/<repo>`, to sanity check that the generated bugs are valid and reproducible.
* `python swesmith/harness/gather.py logs/run_validation/<repo>`, to collect the bugs into a single `logs/task_insts/<repo>.json` file and push valid bugs as branches to the corresponding repository under the [SWE-smith](https://github.com/orgs/swesmith/repositories) organization.
* Push the new bugs to the [SWE-bench/SWE-smith HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith) for all of us to use!

## Add problem statements

🔴 `p1`

Currently, ~40k of the task instances in the [SWE-bench/SWE-smith HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith) do not have problem statements.
It costs ~$0.02 to create one.

```
python swesmith/issue_gen/generate.py -c=configs/issue_gen/ig_v2.yaml -w 8
```
If you want to add problem statements for just a specific repository, use the `--instance_ids` flag to use patterns to filter for specific task instances (e.g. `--instance_ids Instagram__MonkeyType.*`).

This command will populate a `logs/issue_gen/` folder with problem statements for all task instances that don't have one.
Zip this folder, then upload the zipped file as a new PR.
From there, we will attach the problem statements to the corresponding task instances in the [SWE-bench/SWE-smith HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith), and push!
