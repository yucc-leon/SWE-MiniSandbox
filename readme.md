# SWE-MiniSandbox

SWE-MiniSandbox is a lightweight, container-free framework for isolating batched SWE agent interactions and computing execution-based rewards. It also supports multi-node, on-policy reinforcement learning training without relying on Kubernetes or other container orchestration systems.

The framework relies on Linux namespaces, `chroot`, and bind mounts to create secure and efficient environments where SWE agents can interact with the system while remaining isolated from one another.

Python environments are isolated using `venv`, ensuring that each agent has its own dependencies without interference. These `venv`s are managed using different versions of Conda, providing flexibility in the software stack available to each agent.

SWE‑MiniSandbox achieves training performance equivalent to traditional Docker‑based setups.
We provide a WandB training demo comparing both frameworks:

👉 https://wandb.ai/open_source_blank/SWE-MiniSandbox

Using SWE‑bench / SWE‑agent‑LM‑7B, we trained on 1600 SWE‑Smith samples for 200 steps under both the minisandbox and Docker implementations, observing comparable performance.

Additional experiments and detailed methodology can be found in our paper:

## 🚀 Get Started

Read our [documentation](https://lblankl.github.io/SWE-MiniSandbox/index) for detailed instructions on installing and using SWE-MiniSandbox. Before you begin, ensure your machine meets the system requirements below.

### System Requirements

- Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Namespace isolation support (the `unshare --mount` command must be available)
- Bind mount support (the `mount --bind` command must be available)

### Installation

We provide two installation options:

- **Docker image** for quick setup
- **Manual installation** for full control

See the [Installation Guide](https://lblankl.github.io/SWE-MiniSandbox/guide/quick-start#installation) for step-by-step instructions.

### Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, follow the steps in our [Quick Start Guide](https://lblankl.github.io/SWE-MiniSandbox/guide/quick-start).
