Troubleshooting
===============


Placement Group Timeouts
-------------------------

In SkyRL, we use Ray placement groups to request resources for different actors. In Ray clusters that autoscale with KubeRay, placement group creation can take a long time since the cluster might have to add a new node, pull the relevant image and start the container, etc. 
You can use the ``SKYRL_RAY_PG_TIMEOUT_IN_S`` environment variable (Used in the ``.env`` file passed to the ``uv run`` command with ``--env-file``) to increase the timeout for placement group creation (By default, this is 180 seconds)

Multi-node Training
-------------------

For multi-node training, it is helpful to first confirm that your cluster is properly configured. We provide a script at ``scripts/multi_node_nccl_test.py`` to test multi-node communication.

To run the script, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --isolated --env-file .env scripts/multi_node_nccl_test.py --num-nodes 2

.env is optional, but it is recommended to use for configuring environment variables.

Note on ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using RDMA, you may need to customize the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to include the RDMA libraries (Ex: EFA on AWS). We've seen issues with `uv` where the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` is not exported even if it is set in the ``.env`` file. It is recommended to set the ``SKYRL_LD_LIBRARY_PATH_EXPORT=1`` in the ``.env`` file and set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` directly in the current shell.


Illegal Memory Access with vLLM
---------------------------------

In some cases, you may encounter "illegal memory access" errors with vLLM >= 0.10.0: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/23814. Currently, we recommend a workaround by downgrading to vLLM 0.9.2.

With SkyRL, this can be done with the following overrides:


.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --isolated --extra vllm --with vllm==0.9.2 --with transformers==4.53.0 --with torch==2.7.0 --with "flash-attn@https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.7cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl" -- ...
