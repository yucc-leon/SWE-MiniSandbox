Multi-Turn RL for Search with SkyRL
=====================================================

In this example, we walk through an example for training a multi-turn search agent with Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and GRPO (with VLLM async rollouts), using the dataset and recipe
from `Search-R1 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09516>`_.

The full implementation of the search environment can be found in :skyrl_gym_link:`skyrl_gym/envs/search/env.py`.

You can find the exact step by step commands to reproduce our results in the :doc:`../recipes/searchr1` recipe, and you can find a link to our training runs 
with 2, 3, and 4 turns for comparison at our `WandB report <https://api.wandb.ai/links/sky-posttraining-uc-berkeley/5kvkzdzr>`_.


Task Overview
-------------

In this task, the agent is given a natural language question and the ability to query a search engine. The agent can use the search engine to help answer the question.
An example prompt is shown below:

.. code-block:: text

    You are a helpful and harmless assistant.
    
    Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. 
    After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> 
    and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as you want. 
    If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. 
    For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. 

    
    Question: In what year was the company that was founded as Sound of Music added to the S&P 500?

The agent is given ``n`` turns to output an answer to the question within the ``<answer>`` and ``</answer>`` tags, meaning the agent has ``n - 1`` turns to query the search engine by outputting a query inside the ``<search>`` and ``</search>`` tags. 
A reward of 0 is given for incorrect responses, and a reward of 1 is given for correct responses (we do not apply format rewards).

Training Configuration
----------------------
Let's walk through configuration for running GRPO to train a 4-turn search agent on the SearchR1 dataset

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Training configuration at ``skyrl_train/examples/search/run_search.sh``

        generator.max_turns=4 \
        # multi-turn generation format - see `skyrl_train/generators/skyrl_gym_generator.py` for more details
        generator.use_conversation_multi_turn=false \

        # - Environment: environment class, max env workers, search env settings

        trainer.eval_interval=50 \
        ... # logging + checkpointing configuration (see `examples/search/run_search.sh` for the full script)
    
To change the number of turns, you can simply change the ``generator.max_turns`` setting.
For more details on environment implementation, see :skyrl_gym_link:`skyrl_gym/envs/search/env.py`.

Note we add ``stop='["</search>", "</answer>"]'`` for both generation and evaluation sampling parameters
to adhere to the Search-R1 recipe.

If you are using ``generator.use_conversation_multi_turn=true``,
you might want to append an EOS token ID to the end of the response after these stop strings to adhere
to the model's behavior (i.e. ending generation with an EOS token ID rather than say ``</answer>``).
This can be done by setting ``generator.append_eos_token_after_stop_str_in_multi_turn=true`` in the generator config.
The full script is available in `examples/search/run_search_conversation_format.sh`.


Launching Your Training Run
---------------------------

Let's get our training run started! Make sure your WandB API key is set, your dataset paths are correctly set, and that you have launched the local retrieval server, following the :doc:`../recipes/searchr1` recipe instructions.

.. code-block:: bash

    export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_api_key
    bash examples/search/run_search.sh

Now just sit back and watch your model learn to search! You can find a link to our training runs with 2, 3, and 4 turns for comparison at our `WandB report <https://api.wandb.ai/links/sky-posttraining-uc-berkeley/5kvkzdzr>`_.
